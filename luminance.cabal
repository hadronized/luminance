name:                luminance
version:             0.8.2.1
synopsis:            Type-safe, type-level and stateless graphics framework
description:         This package exposes several modules to work with /GPUs/ in a stateless and
                     type-safe way. Currently, it uses OpenGL as backend hardware technology but
                     others will be added later on, such as Vulkan.
                     .
                     One very important point is the fact that luminance has nothing to do with
                     /3D engines/ or /scene development kits/. Don’t expect to find /materials/,
                     /lights/ or /mesh/ loaders. It’s just a graphics framework initiated to fix the
                     design choices of OpenGL. It won’t change in any other way. However, as it
                     grows, the plan is to make luminance a good graphics framework following the
                     Haskell philosophy. In the end, it should be used as-is, not as an OpenGL
                     abstraction.
                     .
                     luminance is a small yet powerful graphics API. It was designed so that
                     people can quickly get their feet wet and start having fun with graphics in
                     /Haskell/. The main idea is to unleash the graphical and visual properties of
                     /GPUs/ in a stateless and type-safe way.
                     .
                     This library doesn’t expose any architectural patterns or designs. It’s up to
                     you to design your program as you want and following your own plans.
                     .
                     In the end, as many people has asked me since the beginning of the development,
                     the OpenGL version – current is 4.5 – will be lowered. You’ll be able to choose
                     the backend to use through compilation flags.
